### Setup

1. [Install go >= 1.11](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. [Install glfw dependencies](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html#compile_deps) - Don't worry about CMake setup
3. Install assimp - `brew install assimp`

## Workflow
All commands are run from the project directory.

- to run: `go run .`
- to test: `go test`
